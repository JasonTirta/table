<h1> WHAT IS A TSUNAMI? </h1>
<h4>A word "Tsunami" itself was taken from japanese words which means the harbour wave, 
    as the another meaning tsunami is a series of waves caused by earthquakes or undersea volcanic eruptions.</h4>
<h3> Which Dominant Points Around the World that Tsunami Most Happened? </h3>
    <p><img src= "Photos/visualization30.png" width="500" height="250">
    </p> 
    <p>This visualisation shows the world map where, there's a some dominant point in the world that records from 1995 to 2020 where tsunami generated during the time. 
        There are several dominant point like in japan where thats generated more than 70 times and and nominated as the most recent tsunami place to happened. </p>
    <aside>
        <p>Tsunami waves may travel as fast as jet planes over deep waters, only slowing down when reaching shallow waters. While tsunamis are often referred to as tidal waves, this name is discouraged by oceanographers because tides have little to do with these giant waves.</p>

<h3> Which Continents Generated more Tsunami? </h3>
<img src= "Photos/visualization40.png" width="400" height="220"> 
    <p> From this visualisation, it shows which are the continents which generate most tsunami. It shows here the dominant continent to have tsunami is Asia followed by Europe whose left in huge difference enough.</p>
    <p> So let's discuss why Asia is the most generated tsunami.</p>

<h3> What Causes Country Generates Tsunami Exists? </h3>
    <img align="right" src= "Photos/visualization60.png" width="200" height="200">
    <p> From this visualisation, it shows the causes that makes tsunami happened. Most of it caused by the Earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. </p>
    <p> Earthquakes itself cause tsunamis by causing a disturbance of the seafloor. Thus, earthquakes that occur along coastlines or anywhere beneath the oceans can generate tsunamis.
        The size of the tsunami is usually related to the size of the earthquake, with larger tsunamis generated by larger earthquakes.</p>
    <p> How about vonvanoes? Volcanoes that occur along coastal zones, like in Japan and island arcs throughout the world, can cause several effects that might generate a tsunami.</p>

<h3> 2 Highest Country Rates Timeline from 1995-2020 </h3>
    <img src= "Photos/visualization 50.png" width="400" height="220">
    <p> Now that we have mentioned Japan and Indonesia are the 2 highest rate country that generated most tsunami that caused fromm the earthquakes and volcanoes. 
        From this visualisation, we can see the timeline where these 2 countries are the two most producing in generating tsunamis from time to time.
